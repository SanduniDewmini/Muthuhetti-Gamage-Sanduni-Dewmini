# üëã Hi, I'm Sanduni Dewmini

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository!  
I am a Statistics graduate from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, currently serving as a Teaching Assistant in the Department of Statistics and was a Research Intern at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI).

I actively contribute to the Statistical Consultancy Service of the University, supporting research and data analysis across multiple domains.

Alongside my academic and research work, I also work as a freelance Mathematics teacher, teaching students from Grade 6 to Ordinary Level.
Passionate about transforming data into meaningful insights through statistical modeling, machine learning, and interactive dashboards.
